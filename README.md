# SoftUni

A collection of labs, exercises and homeworks I made while studying software development at SoftUni.
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a cheat-sheet and a reminder of how certain things work for when I need them.
Everybody who finds this useful is welcome to use it.

An update for the people who might read this 1000 years from now:

Love each other! That's all that matters! :)


Signed,
